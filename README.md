Questions:-


Q: How long did you spend on this assignment? What would you have done differnet if you had more time ?
Ans: I spent around 3.5 hours on this application If I had more time I would have implemented component resuability in the app so that there would less HTML.

Q: What are focus areas if your code would have to be part of an actual application? 
Ans: My main focus areas of code is code resuability, writting less code and achieving more functionality, keeping an eye on the HTTP calls and structuring the app in such a way when any changes are required there is not alot of hassle.
